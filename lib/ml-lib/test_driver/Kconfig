	  This is a ML library testing character device driver for
	  testing generic ML library functionality. It provides:

	  - Basic read/write operations
	  - IOCTL interface for device control
	  - Sysfs attributes for runtime information
	  - Procfs entry for debugging

	  The driver creates a /dev/mllibdev device node that can be
	  used to read and write data to a kernel buffer.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mllibdev.
